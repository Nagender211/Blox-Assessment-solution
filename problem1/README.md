MERN Stack Developer Intern
Mrcitsoft Innovations Pvt. Ltd (May 2024 - July 2024)
 During my internship at Mrcitsoft Innovations, I contributed as a MERN stack developer, focusing on building dynamic user interfaces with React.js and implementing secure authentication processes. Utilizing Google OAuth2, I set up authentication protocols on the backend, using Node.js and Express.js for efficient handling of requests and MongoDB for reliable data storage. Committed to best practices, I maintained clean, modular code and regularly pushed updates to GitHub. This role strengthened my full-stack development expertise, especially in creating scalable and maintainable code for production-ready applications


Full-stack Developer Intern
Dream Potential (November 2023 - January 2024)
As a Full-stack Developer Intern at Dream Potential, I had the opportunity to work on both team-based and independent projects, focusing on delivering responsive and robust applications using the MERN stack. My responsibilities included API integration, fetching and handling data through API keys, and using OAuth2 for secure user authentication. Throughout the internship, I was proactive in writing clean code and optimizing functionality for user-friendly applications. This role allowed me to further develop my full-stack capabilities and gain confidence in handling project deployment, including code management on GitHub.


a. What did the system do?
The system facilitated secure user authentication with Google OAuth2, managed data in MongoDB, and created responsive user interfaces in React. It handled everything from login to database interactions, enabling users to access, update, and interact with data efficiently, making it suitable for various user-driven applications.

b. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?
I've seen similar setups in platforms like e-commerce sites or social media apps, where users require secure logins and seamless data handling. Systems like Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or AWS Amplify are also popular for managing user authentication and backend tasks similarly across different applications.

c. How do you approach the development problem?
I break down each requirement, prioritize security, and structure components modularly. For instance, I handle authentication separately from UI components, making the code scalable. Using resources like documentation and forums, I troubleshoot progressively, ensuring each part works smoothly before integrating the entire system together.

d. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?
One useful code snippet was for efficiently handling API response errors in Node.js. It saved time in handling unexpected server responses and improved code readability. Stack Overflow often has practical solutions for error handling, form validation, and optimal ways to structure MongoDB queries.

e. What did you learn from some very specific copy-paste? Mention explicitly some of them.
From copying a MongoDB aggregation pipeline snippet, I learned how to effectively format and filter query responses for React components. Another instance involved a JavaScript debounce function that improved performance in search functionality by limiting API calls, which streamlined the appâ€™s responsiveness significantly.
